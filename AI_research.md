# Categories:
#### Traditional/Classic: 
* 'supervised learning' ~ humans label data
* uses algorithms and 'conventional techniques'
* rules & logic is used to make decisions
* limited in complex or unstructured data
* Unable to learn (done after creation)
#### Contemporary: 
* 'Unsupervised' and 'reinforcement' learning
* uses lots of data to 'learn' (pattern-recognition)
* can continuously improve & handle unstructured data
* ML, NLP, Computer Vision...
# Types
### 1) Machine Learning *ML*
* Learn from data and improve   
**A)** Support Vector Machines (classification)   
**B)** Random Forests (complex datasets)   
**C)** Desision Trees (complex datasets)   
**D)** Linear/Logistic Regression (easy to build)   
### 2) Deep Learning
* More advanced ML   
* best with large, unstructured data   
**A)** Convolutional Neural Networks *CNN* (Image processing)   
**B)** Recurrent Neural Networks *RNN* (time or language processing)   
**C)** Long Short-Term Memory Networks *LTSM* (special kind of RNN)   
### 3) Generative
* create 'new' simulated data from existing trends   
**A)** Generative Adversarial Networks *GAN* (generation & discrimination)   
**B)** Variational Autoencoders *VAE* (using probability)   
### 4) Hybrid
* Used in very complex situations where multiple are needed   
* eg. computer vision with NLP   
**A)** Integrated Neural Networks (CNN + RNN)   
**B)** Ensamble Methods (non-specific combination)   
### 5) Natural Language Processing *NLP*
* specifically for understanding human language (text data)   
**A)** Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers *BERT* (understand of text)   
**B)** Generative Pre-trained Transformer *GPT* (generating coherent text)   
### 6) Computer Vision
* interaction with the world   
**A)** ALSO CNNS   
**B)** Capsule Networks (identify hierarchies)
