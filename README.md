# dataValidator_AI

### Getting Started
To reduce confusion about versions and differences in software, I've created a Docker dev-container with the necessary python packages.    
Starting the container may take a while (+5 minutes for my first time) however the next time should be much quicker.   
   
Dowload Docker **[here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)** if needed

To adjust any of the packages you want to use in the project, modify the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/RunXPS/dataValidator_AI/blob/main/requirements.txt)![Uploading image.pngâ€¦]()
 file. Some packages may already be commented out.
